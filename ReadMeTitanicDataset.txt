The purpose of doing the Titanic Project is to predict whether a particular individual will be able to survive the
Titanic shipwreck. To do this, the data was first imported. Afterwards, it went through the normal cleaning process.
After that, various regression functions were used from the sklearn library to judge the prediction accuracy. The types of
prediction models used were naive bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, k nearest neighbor, random forest, support 
vector classifier, xtreme gradient boosting and soft voting classifier. Among these, support vector classifier prediction
model turned out to be the most accurate. Using this model, the prediction accuracy about whether or not someone would
survive the titanic sinking disaster would be 83.2%.
